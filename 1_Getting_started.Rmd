## Part I - <<<Name>>>

# Set preferences
    
        Tools > Global Options
    
    
# Create and Save a file
    
        File >  create a new file, open previous files, and save files
    
    
# Interface
    
    Console Panel - this is the pane on the left hand side of the monitor. 
        a) when the Source pane is open it will drop to the bottom of the screen. 
        b) you use it to run commands and see the results of your commands. 

    Source Pane - this is the pane that you are viewing this script in. 
        a) you create and edit scripts which you can then run in the console.
        b) it is important that you can use to using the source pane for writing your commands.

    Environment Pane - view objects and functions that you have created
        
# Tips and Tricks

    1. Run Code - send commands to the console
        a) Use the run button
        b) Keyboard shortcuts
            - CTRL + ENTER (windows)
            - CMD + RETURN (mac)
            - lines from scripts can be run by highlighting the relevant block of code.
            
```{r}


    1 + 4 

    heyThere <- 1 + 4
    heyThere

```

    2. Create Scripts
        a) File-->New File-->
          - R Script <<add description>>
          - RMarkdown <<add description>>
          
    3. Escape commands 
        a) Escape button (esc) will break the execution of a command.
        
```{r}

heyThere <- c(summary(heyThere)

```


    4. Help
      a) Help tab in the Files Panel 
        - tutorials
        - cheat sheets (for available functions and commands)
        - explanations and examples of using commands and functions
        
```{r}

help("read.table")

?vector

#F1 while highlighted

```

    5. TAB button
        a) auto-suggest
            - functions
            - arguments
            - values
            
```{r}

          help()

```

    6. Commentting 
        a) # single lines 
        b) ''' multiline
        c) reminds you what a line of code does
        
        
```{r}

# The Old Pond by Matsuo Bashō

'''
  An old silent pond
  A frog jumps into the pond—
  Splash! Silence again.

'''

```

    7. Packages  
        a) packages only need to be installed once
        b) packages always need to loaded -> library
  
```{r}

help("install.packages")
help("library")

```
    
  
===============================================================================

## Part II - Basic Commands --------------------------------------------------


# Built-in Functions

<<add Descriptions>>

     a) Functions are the operation that can be run on objects in R and values. 
     b) Built-in functions from the bases version of R, or installed and loaded packages. 
     c) You can create your own functions
      
```{r}

# Addition:
  129 + 3483
  
  # Subtraction:
  23693 - 4536
  
  # Multiplication:
  23 * 45
  
  # Division:
  51/3
  
  # Exponents:
  2^4
  
  # Logarithms (base e):
  log(100)
  
  # Range
  1:12
  
  # Sample
  sample(1:50, 10)
  

```

# Arguments

    a) Arguments are the values and parameters that are acted on by the function. 
    b) An argument is a placeholder. 
    c) When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the argument. 
    d) Arguments are optional; that is, a function may contain no arguments.
    e) Also arguments can have default values.
    f) Arguments they must be in order that R requires
    
    
```{r}

  mean(1:300)
  sample(6000:9999, size = 2)
  
  summary(range(1:500), quantile.type = 4)

```


# Objects ---------------------------------------------------------------

objects store information and allow you to call over and over. 

      a) an object can be a single digit, a character, a vector, an imported csv, a data frame. 

```{r}

    a <- 3
    
    b <- 45
    
    a + b
    
    a + b <= 24
    
    my.house <- read.csv("house_2018_bystate.csv")

```

      b) Naming Conventions
        - Use letters, numbers, punctuation, and underscores
            Example 1 - longer.name
            Example 2 - longer_name
            Example 3 - longerName
            
```{r}

  first.example <- sample(3:15, size = 1)
    
  second_example <- round(2.471, digits = 2)
    
  thirdExample <- mean(500:4000)
  
  first.example + second_example / thirdExample
  
```

===============================================================================

## Part III - Data Values

    - When you have input a piece of data into R, the software will interpret it based on default settings. 
    - as.*() -> built in function that can change the value of data

# 1. Integer

    - whole number with nothing after the decimal. 
    - any whole number that a capital L after the digit will be interpreted as an integer

```{r}

  help("integer")

```

```{r}

  exampleInteger <- 400L
    str(exampleInteger) # tells you what class you data is

```

# 2. Double

    - regular numbers (large small, positive, negative, with digits after the decimal, or without)
    
```{r}

help("double")

```

```{r}

  exampleDouble <- 400
    str(exampleDouble)
  

```
  
# 3.  Character 

    - non-numeric data such as text. 
    - To denote a piece of data as a character in R use quotation marks("") around the characters. 
    - R is very literal so even spaces need to be included
 
```{r}

  help('character')

```
 
    
```{r}

  exampleCharacter <- "Hello World"
  exampleCharacter2 <- "26501"
  
    str(exampleCharacter2)


```

# 4. Factors 

    - categorical variables
    - data objects which are used to categorize the data and store it as levels. 
    
```{r}

help("factor")

```
  
```{r}

exampleFactor <- read.csv ("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/tarantino/tarantino.csv", stringsAsFactors = T)
  summary(exampleFactor$movie)
  str(exampleFactor$movie)
  

```

# 5. Logical 

    - boolean data objects that denote TRUE or FALSE 
    
```{r}

help("logical")

```

```{r}

exampleLogical <- T
exampleLogical2 <- FALSE
  
  str(exampleLogical2)


```

===================================================================================

## Part IV - Packages

R is open source code after it's initial development people began adding to it with packages. An R Package is something that you can plug into RStudio to extend the basic functionality that is built in with R. One of the reasons that R has become so popular is because it has this rich ecosystem of packages that really make R a comprehensive platform for data science.

For this workshop we are going to use a package called Tidyverse that was created for people working with data. Let's load it up and install it now.


      # Installing Packages
      
```{r}

help("install.packages")

```
      
```{r}

install.packages("tidyverse") # you only need to install a package once

```

      # Loading Packages
      
```{r}

help("library")

```

```{r}

library(tidyverse) # you need to call the library during each session

```
======================================================================================

## Part V - Exportating Data

    
```{r}

help("write.delim")

write.csv(exampleFactor, "example_factor.csv")

```
    
    You can extract data using R and perform analysis and visualization functions in:
      - R
      - SAS
      - Python
      - STATA
      - SPSS
